## Introduction
Horiseon is an online-based marketing service that aims to help companies build
an internet presence. Through search engine optimization, online reputation management,
and social media marketing, they bring new clientele to businesses.

## My Assignment
My assignment focused on one objective - Accessibility. I made that happen by adding 
Alternate Attributes, Semantic Elements and Proper Website Structure.
These features make it easier for people with disabilities to experience
a webstie with ease when using tools such as Screen Readers.
